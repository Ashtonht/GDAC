These systems, services, platforms, products, and solutions are built in the digital realm, hosted on the internet, on cloud servers, and even blockchain networks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">For example, we have Microsoft Azure, which is a cloud-based Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) service. The purpose of using an IaaS is to avoid investing and implementing your own physical servers, data center, etc., instead each resource is offered in a modular fashion, requiring users to only pay for what they use. Azure manages the infrastructure, the user manages the operation of their software, operating systems, and so on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">We also have Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), another cloud-based solution that allows users to purchase solutions on a pay-as-you-go or subscription basis. Adobe Creative Cloud and Microsoft Office 365 are prime examples of this.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Essentially, &ldquo;as-a-service&quot; platforms take digitization to another level, offering products and services over a network. Typically, these products are offered on more of a rental basis, you never truly own the product yourself. &ldquo;As-a-service&quot; products are not limited to the above examples and are even extending themselves into the realms of medicine and even video games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">But Government-as-a-Service?

Instead, they aimed for the &ldquo;Digital by Default Service Standard&rdquo;. This is held to 26 conditions, that after April 2014, all government services were&nbsp;required to meet before achieving the desired standards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Through the UK&rsquo;s government portal, a multitude of departments, tax calculators, services, and other offerings are available 24/7, with absolute ease of access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Taking this a step further is Estonia, a country that has taken technological statecraft to a whole different level. The project, titled E-Estonia, which began in 2007, has been a resounding success. The normal services linked with government such as legislation, voting, education, healthcare, justice, paying taxes, and so on, have all been packaged into one digital platform, linking the entire nation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Medical data, loan applications, anything outside of physical property transfers such as buying a home, can be done through the E-Estonia platform. According to the E-Estonia website, 99% of state services are online, and 2,773 can be used via their X-road platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">In an even more bizarre twist, foreign nationals can sign up for an Estonian e-Residency. Allowing them to receive a government-issued smart ID and manage a business in the country, even if you don&rsquo;t live there. For example. This means that an entrepreneur from Dubai could establish a company in Estonia, that he operates from China, to serve clients in France, hassle-free.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Estonia has been on the cutting edge of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and GaaS for some years, ahead of the rest of the world.</p>","skin":"WRichTextNewSkin","isQaMode":false,"fullNameCompType":"wysiwyg.viewer.components.WRichText"},"comp-k9c330n2":{"html":"<h2 class=\"font_2\" style=\"line-height:1.1em; font-size:55px;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">4IR and GaaS</span><span class=\"color_33\">.</span></h2>","skin":"WRichTextNewSkin","isQaMode":false,"fullNameCompType":"wysiwyg.viewer.components.WRichText"},"comp-k9c330o1":{"html":"<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Fourth industrial revolution (4IR) technologies, software-based advances such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, 5G, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT), are going to play a gigantic role in shaping the future of our governments and how we interact with them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">In fact, Estonia was the first Nation-State in the entire world to deploy blockchain technology into its systems, which occurred in 2012. The reason that Estonia tapped this technology, to begin with, is because blockchain can provide immutability for data at high speeds.
