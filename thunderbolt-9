These technologies have spent quite some time as investor/entrepreneur-attracting buzzwords, and in many cases were simply used to create hype around products/services that may include a little bit of either. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Simply put, blockchain technology is a distributed, decentralized, immutable ledger; and AI, on the other hand, is an engine or a brain that can manage data analytics and make decisions based upon them. It&rsquo;s safe to presume that the road to merging these technologies is fraught with many tall complicated hurdles, but should they manage to meet in the middle, the opportunities that await at the end of the journey could very well be worth it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Amongst many experts, there is a sense of agreement that despite their complexities, blockchain and AI are both expected to have a gigantic impact on businesses over the next five to ten years.

Google has its Neural Network algorithm, an AI that predicts the outcomes of patients in hospital, and there is also the IBM Watson Supercomputer, another system that analyzes the impact of symptoms. These efforts can save lives, money, resources and time, but also medical advancement. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">One such ambitious effort is that of the Stem Cell Project, a firm that intends to leverage blockchain and AI to accurately screen patients, running diagnostic and pathological imaging systems through their platform. With the tech, they hope to ramp up the speed of stem cell treatments, which is touted by many to be the biggest breakthrough in medical science to date. Additionally, the vision is to create a virtual clinic of sorts, one that minimizes the chance of misdiagnosis, and one that is also accessible for the entire world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">In terms of smashing the technology together in an extraordinarily novel and increasingly common way, look no further than SingularityNET. This is a firm that since 2017, has been developing a blockchain-based AI marketplace, where developers or AI vendors can sell hardware or software services in exchange for the same, or cryptocurrency. Additionally, the open-source marketplace allows businesses and developers to add AI or machine learning services to the ecosystem and earn cryptocurrency. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">As per the SingularityNET whitepaper, the marketplace provides buyers and sellers with smart-contract templates, allowing for the automation of transactions; in doing so, users are supplied with a standardized set of software and hardware APIs which can be implemented into these smart contract templates. These services can be simple services that perhaps translate text-based documents into different languages, or they can be large-scale in image/video processing. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">The SingularityNET vision is to open up AI technologies to the world, creating a platform where AIs can communicate and coordinate, and this is made all the more possible with thanks to the backing of blockchain technology. Though the implications of this technology for businesses and individuals are gigantic, the platform is still infantile. Time will tell if this type of platform will have a place in the world, or if it&rsquo;s merely a stepping stone toward a more robust ecosystem. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Providing solutions to supply chains is a company called Bext360, the firm is using AI and blockchain to boost transparency of supply chains, as well as increase efficiencies across several industries including seafood, minerals, coffee, and timber.
