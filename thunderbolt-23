Typically, your finances are handled by centralized entities, singular authorities who either issue the currencies we use, or manage and regulate them - this includes banks, FinTech companies like PayPal and the like. As mentioned earlier, DeFi is built upon blockchain technology, most commonly on the Ethereum blockchain, though that is a whole other topic to explore itself. Regardlesss, blockchain is a new and exciting slice of tech that has proven its worth with thanks to the outstanding performance of Bitcoin (BTC) over the past few years.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">In short, it all began when enigmatic entity Satoshi Nakamoto created the first ever blockchain on which the premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, would then exist. Here he proved that the technology has the capacity to create a new financial ecosystem away from centralized systems, making private peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions of value a possibility. To many, this is considered where DeFi began.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Soon, tech-savvy early adopters caught whiff of the potential locked within this new currency/asset/property, and began building upon it, around it, for it.

However, there are also cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins that could be considered as the most critical component to the DeFi ecosystem next to Ethereum&rsquo;s native crypto Ether (ETH), providing a solid financial foundation for anyone with access to the internet.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Stablecoins are unique in that they don&rsquo;t change value as they are pegged to either a basket of assets, fiat currency or both, thus ensuring that their price remains, as the name implies, stable. Prime examples of stablecoins include Tether (USDT), Dai (DAI) and USD Coin (USDC). In a report from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), they note that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies &ldquo;failed to provide a reliable and attractive means of payment or store of value.&rdquo;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">The BIS also argues that regardless of the modern financial system and its many improvements, it has two critical flaws. One being that there is no &ldquo;universal access to financial services&rdquo;, citing the 1.7 billion adults in the world who have no access transaction accounts as clear evidence of this. The second matter, is that cross-border retail payments aren&rsquo;t quite up to scratch as they are slow and costly.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Although the BIS report makes acknowledgements of the numerous impacts that stablecoins can have on economies, individuals and enterprises, both positive and negative, there is one key takeaway to note. The BIS is of the impression that for stablecoins to meet the needs or the &ldquo;unbanked and underserved&rdquo;, then they need to prove themselves as the safe stores of value they present themselves to be. Meanwhile, that experiment is taking place across the world with the many active participants of DeFi.</span></p>","skin":"WRichTextNewSkin","isQaMode":false,"fullNameCompType":"wysiwyg.viewer.components.WRichText"},"comp-k8fjew9d":{"html":"<h2 class=\"font_2\" style=\"font-size:68px; line-height:1.1em;\"><span style=\"font-size:68px;\"><span class=\"color_15\">DeFi </span></span><span style=\"font-size:68px;\"><span class=\"color_15\">in Action</span><span class=\"color_18\">.</span></span></h2>","skin":"WRichTextNewSkin","isQaMode":false,"fullNameCompType":"wysiwyg.viewer.components.WRichText"},"comp-k8fjgdpe":{"html":"<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:19px;\"><span class=\"color_18\"><span style=\"font-size:19px;\">The DeFi ecosystem is a sea of services and platforms tailored to meet the needs of the digital economy.</span></span></p>","skin":"WRichTextNewSkin","isQaMode":false,"fullNameCompType":"wysiwyg.viewer.components.WRichText"},"comp-k8fjkhrp":{"html":"<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-family:avenir-lt-w01_35-light1475496,sans-serif;\">As a basic means to enter the DeFi landscape, access cryptocurrency and browse dApps to your hearts content, look no further than MetaMask.
