According to a 2016 book titled &ldquo;The Fourth Industrial Revolution&rdquo; published by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF), he argues that the current technological revolution is one &ldquo;that is blurring the lines between physical, digital, and biological spheres.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">The roster of 4IR technologies is vast, including the likes of Artificial Intelligence (AI); Blockchain; Quantum Computing; 3D Printing; the Internet of Things (IoT); Robotics; 5G; Nanotechnology; Biotechnology, and so on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">In essence, 4IR technologies are ones that interface with us, as opposed to us interfacing with them. A very small and simple example of this is our phones; for many years we&rsquo;ve been the one interacting directly with our phones, making manual inputs to get the desired results, but now our phones are able to recognize our faces and voices for various command functions. Taking it a step further, our cars are beginning to drive themselves, and humans are beginning to augment themselves with robotic eyes and artificial limbs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Here at GDAC, we are examining a number of these technologies, as well as the sectors they&rsquo;ll be transforming in preparation for when the fourth industrial revolution is in its prime.</p>","skin":"WRichTextNewSkin","isQaMode":false,"fullNameCompType":"wysiwyg.viewer.components.WRichText"},"comp-k98oajb9":{"html":"<h2 class=\"font_2\" style=\"line-height:1.1em; font-size:55px;\"><span class=\"color_15\">Team Effort</span><span class=\"color_27\">.</span></h2>","skin":"WRichTextNewSkin","isQaMode":false,"fullNameCompType":"wysiwyg.viewer.components.WRichText"},"comp-k98oajc9":{"html":"<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Pre-existing and new technologies are typically designed to work together/upgrade one another in a myriad of ways, creating a bustling ecosystem that seems to operate seamlessly without us even realizing it.

A digital brain, capable of making its own decisions, learning, adapting and even creating. At its most primitive, we have Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa and Apple&rsquo;s Siri for example, and at the higher end, you have self-driving cars from Tesla, a modern marvel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">IoT technology has been in existence for quite a while. Almost any object or person in the world can become a part of the IoT ecosystem; it&rsquo;s a network of physical devices or sensors that are able to communicate with each other and various systems for a vast array of applications. IoT sensors can help maintain sustainable farming/fishing levels by collecting real-time data on certain conditions, or they can exist in a humble drink vending machine, that will automatically let its supplier know when it requires a stock to be replenishment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Blockchain offers a decentralized network of transparent and immutable ledgers, maintaining data accuracy and security. Whereas contrastingly, AI is the understanding of data, an autonomous machine. But when combined, a blockchain network acts as a secure data transfer gateway for an AI, which will require secure and accurate inter-device communications. Add IoT sensors into the mix, and you have a hyperconnected network of machines, devices, autonomous systems and databases that can impact any of the aforementioned 4IR technologies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Though there are going to be many growing pains in bringing these worlds together, as is often the case, it is believed that once symbiosis is achieved, a wealth of opportunity awaits.
