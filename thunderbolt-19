In this third instance of technological upheaval, the world began its digital revolution. In this era, we witnessed the emergence of mainframe computing, personal computers, information technology, advances in telecommunications, biotechnology and eventually space exploration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">For the world&rsquo;s industries, two major inventions are likely the reason behind our ability to produce high-spec machinery, circuit boards, and any other tech marvel that emerged in those times.

Though concerns of robots overthrowing mankind entirely are somewhat irrational, despite the fact that certain companies are building robotics specifically for warfare purposes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Humans are getting robotic upgrades with artificial limbs, eyes and other amazing augmentations that are beginning to blur the line between humans and machines.

Due to robot automation, unemployment rates in 1958 reached approximately 7.5 percent. Thousands of workers lost their jobs to machines, and seemingly there was no plan to recover from the Automation Depression.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">In part, the author of the article writes:</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">&ldquo;We are stumbling blindly into the automation era with no concept or plan to reconcile the need of workers for income and the need of business for cost-cutting and worker-displacing innovations,&rdquo;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">These problems do indeed persist today, robots are either already here doing work for us, or soon will be. Historically, any technological innovation has managed to replace or augment the position of a human in a given job, but by the end of the 20th century, it was apparent that society simply needed to adjust to the new norms, even though many suffered as a result.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">According to a 2017 research paper titled &ldquo;The Impacts of Robots on Productivity, Employment and Jobs&rdquo; from the International Federation of Robotics, (IFR) automation has resulted in some very positive outcomes aside from productivity and improving competitiveness. The IFR found that whilst middle income/skilled jobs were overall being reduced, the new skill range of workers in that middle bracket is quite large. Furthermore, robots have created a demand for high-skilled workers, though the issue of upskilling and retraining those in the lower-income spectrum remains somewhat a challenge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">In addition, the paper explains that robots &ldquo;complement and augment labor&rdquo;, meaning that robots substitute labor activities, but do not replace jobs. According to the data they collected, less than 10% of jobs are &ldquo;fully automatable&rdquo;, making the implication that humans and robots will work together in many fields, though that doesn&rsquo;t stop the drive for robotics being applied in any area.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Market research company Forrester believes that within the next decade or so, robotics in the U.S. will create almost 13 million new jobs that had never existed before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">The IFR report agrees, and to ram that point home using the U.S. automotive industry as a prime example, the study says that between 2010 and 2015 more than 60,000 industrial robots were installed, and in this time the number of employees in this sector rose by approximately 230,000.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">So yes, there will be steep learning curves, worker displacement and even some unexpected troubles that could arrive with higher-tech robotics, but seemingly they are essential to not only advancing society but securing our economy too.</p>","skin":"WRichTextNewSkin","isQaMode":false,"fullNameCompType":"wysiwyg.viewer.components.WRichText"},"comp-k9259db5":{"html":"<h2 class=\"font_2\" style=\"line-height:1.1em; font-size:55px;\"><span class=\"color_15\">Now and Then</span><span class=\"color_27\">.</span></h2>","skin":"WRichTextNewSkin","isQaMode":false,"fullNameCompType":"wysiwyg.viewer.components.WRichText"},"comp-k9259dc2":{"html":"<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">The fourth industrial revolution (4IR) started roughly at the beginning of the 2000s with the Internet and other marvels like big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), AI becoming mainstays in the operations of many enterprises and institutions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Advancements in other 4IR technologies also are causing robotics to become more commonplace in areas outside of industrial settings. Using 3D printers, engineers at the University of California San Diego managed to establish a means to create robots at low cost and high speeds, these have been dubbed as &lsquo;flexoskeletons&rsquo;. The implications are huge, as reportedly it takes approximately 10 minutes to print one for the cost of less than $1, and then a total of two hours to assemble the flexoskeleton into an operational robot, for whatever purpose it has been designed for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">Accessibility into robotics is a real game-changer, meaning that innovation can take off at breakneck speeds as anyone with access to a 3D printer and some know-how can potentially change the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">AI and IoT will be major roles in our new industrial era, but there is no shadow of a doubt that robotics may benefit the most from them, and become the poster-child for the 4IR.</p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\"><span class=\"wixGuard\">​</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"font_8\" style=\"font-size:14px;\">The more complexly mechanized and intelligent our machines are, the more they can communicate, operate and even upgrade themselves.
